            There used to be a humble blog here; what feels like a life time ago
            now.

            Unfortunately, most of it was old and out dated; technology moves at
            a relentless pace, right? This was once an active archive of,
            normally small, web development code snippets providing solutions.
            It was a collection crafted during my early software developer days,
            where I had to learn fast and hard to survive! It was more of a
            personal scratchpad, than anything else. Some articles became quite
            popular in its hayday, and others barely received enough views to
            count on my fingers. The articles were filled with JavaScript, PHP,
            CSS and loads of other web related stuff. Anything I basically
            stumbled into during my early days of learning, which I thought
            would be useful for others, or something I'd almost certainly forget
            about in the future; acting as a kind of self reference.

            Looking back, it was a thrilling era, and one that'll be missed.

            In an attempt to hold onto my nostalgia of this time, I migrated
            some of the guides to https://guides.codechewing.com; these guides
            were either good enough as is, or needed only a little TLC to be
            acceptable for readers. Sadly, this ended up receiving no attention
            either, and I've decided to take it down. Blogs cost a tremendous
            amount of energy and time. It's hard to justify when bills have to
            get paid and family has to be fed.

            As a tribute, the original Code Chewing logo is at the top of this
            page :'(
